### Goal of the project

Create a simple game using pygame for the Programming fundamentals Course unit.

### Description of the project

It consists of a simple fight game in Pokemon style. <br>
During the game, you move through a map full of enemies, if you make contact with an enemy a battle begins.<br>
During the fight, each character plays in turns.<br>
Each enemy has two elements attack and a simple sword attack.<br>
Some elements are effective against other elements causing extra damage, and others are ineffective causing less damage, sword attacks have no element.<br>
You control a character with four base attacks: wind, electric, sword, and shield.<br>
When making an attack you need to make an accuracy minigame, the more accurate you are the more damage you make.<br>
Adding to that when making an element attack you also play another algorithm to charge the attack the more you charge the more damage you make
